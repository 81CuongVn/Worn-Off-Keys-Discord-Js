HOW TO USE CONFIG.JSON:

Create a file called "config.json" within your project folder. It will have this syntax:

```
{
  "token": "bot token here",
  "prefix": "default command prefix here",
  "mongoPath": "mongo path here",
  "redisPath": "redis path here"
}
```

Redis and mongo can be ignored depending on where you are in the series.
